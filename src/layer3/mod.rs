//! Layer 3: Galactic Level Simulation
//!
//! This layer handles galaxy-wide simulation aspects, connecting solar systems and factions.
//! It serves as the grand strategy ("Stellaris") layer, managing macro-scale civilization dynamics.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! ## Interstellar Relations
//! The galaxy is shaped by the interactions of vast factions:
//! - **Diplomacy:** Treaties, council resolutions, and negotiations (`diplomacy`, `council`).
//! - **Conflict:** Sovereign armadas, pirates, and ghost ships (`fleets`, `pirates`, `ghost_ships`).
//!
//! ## The Galactic Market
//! A macro-economy that transcends individual systems:
//! - Features subjective economics and corporate bureaucracy (`market`, `economy`).
//!
//! ## Galactic Geography
//! - The galactic map and stellar cartography track the known universe (`map`, `stellar_cartography`).
//!
//! # Simulation Flow
//! This layer abstracts the minute details of Layer 1 and 2, focusing instead on high-level
//! events (`events`), galactic silence (`silence`), and the shifting power dynamics of a universe
//! inhabited by countless civilizations.
